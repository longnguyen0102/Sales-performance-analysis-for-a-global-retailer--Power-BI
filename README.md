1. ⌚ Time:  
 - Sales grew steadily from **$2.26M in 2011** to **$4.3M in 2014** — an increase of about **90%**.
 - **Profit** rose from **$248.96K in 2011** to **$504.17K in 2014** — more than **doubling** over the period.
 - **Profit margin** remained stable, moving from **11% to 11.9%**, indicating consistent profitability — a positive sign for sustainable business performance.
 - From **August** to **December**, both Profit and Revenue increased. This growth was driven by:
   - August being a demand-boosting period to stimulate consumer spending.
   - The year-end holiday season, when consumers tend to spend more.
   - September often marking the launch of new product models, prompting higher purchase activity.

2. 🗂️ Segment
 - The **Consumer** segment consistently accounts for the largest share (**47%–54%** each year) → this segment remains the primary focus to drive profitability for the company.
 - The **Corporate** segment ranks second **(~28%–34%)**, followed by **Home Office** with the smallest share.

3. 🏞️ Region
 - Regions with high **Profit Margins** include **Canada (21%–30%)**, **North Asia (18.3%–20.8%)**, and **Central Asia (16.9%–18.3%)**. Canada shows strong potential for market expansion, while North Asia and Central Asia are worth considering for further investment.
 - **Central US** consistently generates the highest absolute **Profit** across years; however, its **Profit Margin** remains at an average level → optimizing costs could further improve profitability.
 - **SEA** and **EMEA** are the weakest performers, showing both low **Profit Margin** and low Profit over the years → these regions should not be prioritized for expansion at this stage.  

#### ✔️ Recommendation:
With steady year-over-year growth in **Sales and Profit**, along with stable **Profit Margins**, the company is on a healthy growth trajectory. Departments should continue to sustain this momentum to maintain stable performance.  
The **Consumer segment** remains the key focus as it generates the highest profitability for the company. However, it is also recommended to introduce targeted promotions or special offers for **Corporate** and **Home Office** customers to maximize overall revenue.  
On the regional side:  
- **SEA** and **EMEA** should be reconsidered for further expansion, as both deliver relatively low Profit.  
- **Canada** deserves attention: while its **Profit Margin** is high, its total **Profit** remains the lowest among regions.  
- **North Asia** and **Central Asia** stand out as attractive opportunities for investment thanks to consistent **Profit Margins (16%–20%)** and relatively strong **Total Profit** compared to other regions.
